<h3>Princess Bride</h3>
<p>If there are, we all be dead. Well, I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely. And YOU: friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless! Do you want me to send you back to where you were? Unemployed, in Greenland? No, there is too much. Let me sum up. Buttercup is marry' Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour. So all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape... after I kill Count Rugen. You seem a decent fellow... I hate to kill you. Naturally... but I find that Thibault cancels out Capa Ferro. Don't you?</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>

Suspendisse turpis risus, tempor id blandit faucibus, faucibus at nisi. Aliquam ultricies diam libero, eget condimentum nisl rutrum nec.</p>

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>Captain. Yes, sir? Tell them we wish to board at once. With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately. Yes, yes, of course, as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador. I'm TC-14 at your service.</p>
